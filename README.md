# PCA-On-Large-Datasets

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction on large 
datasets. With the advent of big data, handling large datasets has become a challenging task in the field of data 
analysis. PCA helps in reducing the number of features while retaining most of the information, thereby enabling faster 
processing of the data. This technique has been successfully applied to various fields such as image processing, signal 
processing, genomics, and finance, among others.

In this project, we explore the use of PCA on large datasets with a focus on the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset.
The LFW dataset is a collection of more than 13,000 face images of 5,749 people collected from the internet. With such a 
large dataset, performing tasks such as face recognition, classification, and clustering becomes computationally 
expensive. PCA can be used to extract the most important features from the dataset and reduce the dimensionality, thereby 
making the analysis more efficient.

In this report, we provide a step-by-step guide on using PCA on the LFW dataset. We first introduce the LFW dataset and 
its properties. We then explain the PCA algorithm and how it can be used for feature extraction and dimensionality 
reduction. We also provide code examples for performing PCA on the LFW dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in 
reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most important information. Finally, we discuss some 
additional applications of PCA on large datasets
